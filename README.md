A simple 2D convolutional model which detects and classifies the ripeness of a banana. Ripeness is separated into three ranges:
- Unripe/Green
- Yellowish-green
- Ripe/Yellow
- Over Ripe

The model includes extraction of the banana from its background, segregation of the colors of the banana, and finally data augmentation to increase the dataset. The model is trained with all the expanded dataset and used to detect bananas in real life through pictures.

A simple 2D convolutional model which detects and classifies the ripeness of a banana. Ripeness is separated into three ranges:
- Unripe/Green
- Yellowish-green
- Ripe/Yellow
- Over Ripe

Our study aims to study the effects image masking and segmentation with R-CNN model have on the accuracy of determining the banana's ripeness. Selected models like CNN and ANN were then trained on the dataset to make prediction with images of bananas taken in real life.
